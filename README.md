# Solving problems using data structures and algorithms

Trying to improve my understanding of the working of computer by analysing it's logic that runs on the fundamental's of data-structures and algorithms

I write comment on ecah code in a way that i understood it, and how i approached the solution, aor how i learned it. This repository repesent my current ability of problem solving ( if i don't forget the algorithms first )
