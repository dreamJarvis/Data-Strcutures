# Solving problems using data structures and algorithms

Trying to improve my understanding of the working of the computer by analysing the logic that is runs on by learing it's fundamental structures and algorithms

I write comment on ecah code in a way that i understood it, and how i approached the solution, aor how i learned it. This repository repesent my current ability of problem solving ( if i don't forget the algorithms first )
